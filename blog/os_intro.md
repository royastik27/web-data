## Operating System
---

**Operating System:** An operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware and provides a basis for application programs acting as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.

There is a wide variety of operating systems developed for accomplishing the tasks:
(i) Mainframe operation systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization of hardware.  
(ii) Personal computer (PC) operating systems support complex games, business applications and everything in between.  
(iii) Operating systems for handheld computers are designed to provide an environment in which a user can easily interface with the computer to execute programs.

Thus some operating systems are designed to be efficient, others to be convenient, and others some combination of two.

We can view a computer system as consisting of <ins>hardware</ins>, <ins>software</ins> and <ins>data</ins>. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in th eopreating of the computer system.  
An Operating system is similar to a government. A government performs no useful function by itself, but simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.
