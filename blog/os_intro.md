## Operating System
---

**Operating System:** An operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware and provides a basis for application programs acting as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.

There is a wide variety of operating systems developed for accomplishing the tasks:  
(i) Mainframe operation systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization of hardware.  
(ii) Personal computer (PC) operating systems support complex games, business applications and everything in between.  
(iii) Operating systems for handheld computers are designed to provide an environment in which a user can easily interface with the computer to execute programs.

Thus some operating systems are designed to be efficient, others to be convenient, and others some combination of two.

We can view a computer system as consisting of hardware, software and data. The operating system provides the means for proper use of these resources in th eopreating of the computer system.  
An Operating system is similar to a government. A government performs no useful function by itself, but simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.

## OS role w.r.t differnt views

**User view:** The user view of the computer varies according to the interface being used. For example:

(i) Most computer users use personal computers. In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for the ease of use, with some attention paid to performance, and none paid to resource utilization (how various hardware and sofware resources are shared).  
(ii) In another case, a user sits at a terminal connected to a mainframe or a minicomputer. Other users are accessing the same computer through other terminals. These users share resources and may exchange information. The operating system in such cases ~~is designed to maximize resource utilization~~.


> A minicomputer is larger and more powerful than a personal computer. Minicomputers are used by small businesses or departments within a company for tasks that require more computing power and can support multiple users simultaneously. Personal computers (PCs) are designed for individual use, typically for tasks like web browsing, word processing, and gaming. Minicomputers are less common today as PCs have become more powerful.
